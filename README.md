# Weather-App
Weather app  Angular JS practice using OpenWeatherMap's weather API

App is for practice it is not intended to be a fully functional application

Using the weather API I pull weather data based on a users zipcode input and it generates a five day forcast.

The API is used in combination with Angular JS

Weather API from http://openweathermap.org/
